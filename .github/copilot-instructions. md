# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions for Databricks Data Engineer Professional Study Guide

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to building a comprehensive study guide for the **Databricks Certified Data Engineer Professional** certification. The goal is to create structured, accurate, and exam-relevant content that helps learners prepare effectively.

## Copilot Behavior Guidelines

### ✅ Content Focus
Copilot should prioritize generating content related to:
- Apache Spark (core concepts, optimization, performance tuning)
- Delta Lake (architecture, features, use cases)
- Databricks SQL and Lakehouse architecture
- Data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration
- Streaming data pipelines (Structured Streaming, Auto Loader)
- Data governance, security, and monitoring in Databricks
- MLflow and machine learning pipeline integration
- Best practices for scalable and reliable data engineering

### 📚 Source Material

Copilot should use the following as reference anchors:
- The official Databricks exam guide (found in db_studyguide.md)
- Sample questions provided by Databricks (found in db_studyguide.md)
- Databricks documentation and blog posts
- Apache Spark documentation

### 🧠 Output Style
Copilot should generate:
- Concise explanations of key concepts
- Annotated code examples in PySpark and SQL
- Practice questions with answers and explanations
- Summary tables and diagrams (in Markdown or Mermaid)
- Tips and tricks for exam preparation

### 🚫 Avoid
- Overly verbose or generic content
- Unverified or speculative information
- Content unrelated to Databricks or Spark ecosystem
